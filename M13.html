<p>BETA-013, later named Mei, is a character from the currently concepted <a href="#">Murder Drones: KILL C0DE</a>. She is a kind and cuirous <a href="#">Murder Drone
</a>who wants to instead make peace with the <a href="#">Worker Drones</a> after being "<i>kicked out</i>" her former squad of Murder Drones for being too soft
and useless design.</p>

<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>013 has features similar to that of a typical female <a href="#">Disassembly Drone</a> with neon yellow eyes and medium silverish hair pulled into a low and loose
ponytail in the back. Like other Murder Drones, she has  a black headband with five sections of lights and a long black tail ending in a large syringe. Unlike her
headband, her syringe is filled with a slightly transparent silver liquid istead of neon yellow liquid.
